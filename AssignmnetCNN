Title: Handwritten Digit Classification using CNN on MNIST Dataset
Duration: 2 Hours
Dataset: MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset
Objective:
• Understand Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
• Implement CNN-based image classification
• Design two CNN models with different hidden layers
• Compare shallow and deep CNN architectures
Problem Statement:
Design and implement a CNN-based system to classify handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST
dataset. Students must implement two CNN models with different depths and compare their
performance.
Tasks:
Task 1: Load and preprocess MNIST dataset
Task 2: Implement Shallow CNN (1 Convolutional layer)
Task 3: Implement Deep CNN (3 or more Convolutional layers)
Task 4: Compare accuracy, loss, number of parameters, and training time
Submission Requirements:
• Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
• Screenshots of training results
• Comparison table
• Brief observations (half page)
