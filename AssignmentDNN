Assignment: Deep Neural Network for Handwritten
Digit Recognition
Objective: Implement a multi-layer Deep Neural Network (DNN) to classify handwritten digits
from the MNIST dataset with at least 97% accuracy on the test set.
1. Dataset Overview
The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9).
● Image size: 28 \times 28 pixels.
● Training set: 60,000 images.
● Testing set: 10,000 images.
2. Tasks & Requirements
Task 1: Data Preprocessing
Before feeding data into a DNN, it must be formatted correctly.
● Normalization: Convert pixel values from the range [0, 255] to [0, 1].
● Flattening: Reshape the 28 \times 28 2D images into a 1D vector of size 784 (28 \times
28 = 784).
Task 2: Architecture Design
Design a Sequential model with the following layers:
● Input Layer: 784 units.
● Hidden Layer 1: 512 neurons with ReLU activation.
● Dropout Layer: 20\% rate (to prevent overfitting).
● Hidden Layer 2: 256 neurons with ReLU activation.
● Output Layer: 10 neurons with Softmax activation (to output probabilities for each class).
Task 3: Training Configuration
Set up the following hyperparameters and components:
● Loss Function: categorical_crossentropy.
● Optimizer: Adam or RMSprop.
● Metrics: accuracy.
● Batch Size: 128.
● Epochs: 10 to 20.
3. Analysis Questions
After completing the training, answer the following:
1. Overfitting Check: Plot the training accuracy vs. validation accuracy. Does the model
overfit? How can you tell?
2. Activation Functions: What happens to the convergence speed if you replace ReLU
with Sigmoid in the hidden layers?
3. Error Analysis: Identify three images the model classified incorrectly. What digits were
they, and why might the model have struggled with them?
