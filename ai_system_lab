AI Systems Laboratory – Graded Lab Work
Date: 7th February 2026
Total Marks: 15 (Answer any THREE questions out of FIVE, 5 marks each)
Instructions:
1. Answer any THREE questions out of FIVE.
2. Each question carries 5 marks (3 × 5 = 15).
3. AI plagiarism will be checked. (Do not copy paste from AI tools).
4. Create a separate document consisting of codes along with appropriate comments and outputs.
5. Students are free to choose any suitable dataset for each task.
Q1. Naive Bayes Classifier
Implement a Naive Bayes classifier using Python for a classification problem of your choice. Show data
preprocessing, model training, prediction, and accuracy evaluation.
Q2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Implement the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm using a dataset of your choice. Justify the selection of K, explain the
distance metric used, and report classification accuracy.
Q3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Apply Principal Component Analysis on any suitable dataset to reduce dimensionality. Explain data standardization,
principal components, and variance retention.
Q4. K-Means Clustering
Implement K-Means clustering on a dataset of your choice. Explain cluster selection, centroid computation, and
visualize the clusters.
Q5. Comparative Analysis
Compare Naive Bayes, KNN, PCA, and K-Means with respect to applicability, computational complexity, strengths,
and limitations. Provide brief conclusions.
